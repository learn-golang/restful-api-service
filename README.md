**Learn Golang in hard way**


In this repository you can find reference project samples of building ReSTful JSON API service using top-rated Golang frameworks like:

 * [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux)
 * [labstack/echo](https://echo.labstack.com/)
 * [go-martini/martini](https://github.com/go-martini/martini)

It would be a good start point for developing your own services picking the best option you see.
